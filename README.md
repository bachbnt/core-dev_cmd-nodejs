## Features

- Scaffold JavaScript, mobile, and Python web projects with framework-appropriate defaults.
- Pass project or device targets directly, or use interactive prompts.
- Preview commands with `--dry-run`.
- Select TypeScript/JavaScript, package manager, Git, and ESLint where supported.
- Inspect device runtime and boot status.
- Cold boot Android emulators and shut down all iOS simulators.
- View command history and repeat the latest successful command.
- Detect Node.js, Python, Flutter, Android, and iOS projects from any child directory.
- Use consistent `install`, `run`, `test`, `build`, `clean`, and `open` commands.
- Inspect detected projects and their resolved lifecycle commands before execution.
- Run framework-aware quality checks with one `dev check` command.
- Add trusted user-defined framework recipes without changing DevCmd source.
- Check the local toolchain with `dev doctor`.
- Store defaults and recently used projects under `~/.devcmd`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.19 or newer, including npm.
- Android Studio is only required for Android emulator features.
- Xcode is only required for iOS simulator features.
- Framework SDKs are only required for the frameworks you use, such as Flutter or Python.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DevCmd by `bachbnt` is not published to the npm registry. The registry package named `devcmd` belongs to a different project. Do not install this project with `npm install --global devcmd` or run it with `npx devcmd`; use one of the GitHub URLs below.

### Download

Open the latest GitHub Release to view release notes and downloadable source archives:

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/bachbnt/dev-cmd/releases/latest)

Downloading an archive does not install the CLI automatically. Until a signed macOS installer is provided, use npm as the installer with a GitHub URL below. npm downloads DevCmd from GitHub, not from the npm registry, and no repository clone is required.

### Install the current source

Install the newest committed source from the `main` branch. This is the installation that matches the current README:

```bash
npm install --global https://github.com/bachbnt/dev-cmd/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
```

The installation provides both `dev` and `devcmd`. Verify the CLI and inspect the tools available on your machine:

```bash
dev help
dev doctor
```

You can use the full command name if `dev` conflicts with another executable:

```bash
devcmd help
```

No repository checkout, `chmod`, `npm link`, or shell `source` command is needed.

### Install a tagged release

<!-- devcmd-release-version:start -->
For a reproducible released snapshot, install a specific GitHub tag. The tag matching the current package version is `v2.4.1`:

```bash
npm install --global https://github.com/bachbnt/dev-cmd/archive/refs/tags/v2.4.1.tar.gz
```
<!-- devcmd-release-version:end -->

Tagged releases can predate features documented on `main`. Check [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bachbnt/dev-cmd/releases) for newer tags and release notes. These archive URLs do not require Git.

### Update or uninstall

Install a newer release tag, or run the `main` installation command again, to update DevCmd. To remove a GitHub-installed copy:

```bash
npm uninstall --global devcmd
```

The uninstall command uses the package name recorded by the installed GitHub archive. It does not mean this project is available from the npm registry.

When using NVM, global npm packages belong to the active Node.js version. Install DevCmd once for each Node.js version where it should be available. If the command is not found immediately after installation, open a new terminal and check the active npm prefix with `npm config get prefix`.

### Alternative GitHub syntax

If Git is installed, npm also accepts this shorter syntax for the latest source on `main`:

```bash
npm install --global github:bachbnt/dev-cmd
```

### Local development only

Cloning is only needed when contributing to DevCmd itself. Clone the repository, then run the reusable setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bachbnt/dev-cmd.git
cd dev-cmd
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
# or
npm run setup
```

The setup installs dependencies and creates an npm symlink from the active Node.js installation to the local repository. Run it once; later source changes are used automatically the next time `dev` runs, without `source ~/.zshrc` or relinking.

## Usage

```bash
dev <command> [target] [options]
# or
devcmd <command> [target] [options]
```

Interactive project creation:

```bash
dev next
```

Direct, non-interactive project creation:

```bash
dev react my-app --typescript --pnpm --git
dev next my-app --typescript --npm --eslint
dev nuxt my-app --pnpm --git
dev vue my-app --javascript --yarn --no-eslint
dev django my-app
dev fastapi my-api
dev flask my-app
```

Preview without executing:

```bash
dev flutter demo --dry-run
```

Check installed development tools:

```bash
dev doctor
```

Inspect the current project without executing anything:

```bash
dev inspect
dev inspect ../my-project
```

## Framework Commands

| Command | Scaffolder |
| --- | --- |
| `flutter` | `flutter create` |
| `react` | Vite React template for apps built from scratch |
| `react_native` | Expo via `create-expo-app` (recommended) |
| `react_native_cli` | React Native Community CLI without a framework |
| `next` | `create-next-app` |
| `nuxt` | Official `create-nuxt` minimal starter |
| `vue` | Official `create-vue` |
| `express` | Official `express-generator` |
| `nest` | Nest CLI |
| `django` | Official Django `startproject` inside a local virtual environment |
| `fastapi` | Minimal FastAPI package with tests and `pyproject.toml` |
| `flask` | Flask application factory with tests and `pyproject.toml` |

Direct targets use recommended defaults: TypeScript, npm, Git, and ESLint where the selected scaffolder supports them. Run a framework command without a target to configure supported presets interactively.

React recommends using a framework for new production applications. Use `dev next` for a full-stack React framework, or `dev react` when a client-side Vite application is the right fit. React Native recommends a framework, so `dev react_native` uses Expo; use `dev react_native_cli` only when framework constraints do not fit the project.

Nuxt is the full-stack Vue option. Nuxt has built-in TypeScript support, so `dev nuxt` exposes package manager and Git choices without a redundant TypeScript/JavaScript flag.

Python projects create a local `.venv`, install their declared dependencies, and include development instructions in the generated README. Django uses the official project generator; FastAPI and Flask use small DevCmd templates based on their official recommended layouts.

```bash
dev django my-app
dev fastapi my-api --no-git
dev flask my-app
```

```bash
dev react web-app --typescript --pnpm
dev react_native mobile-app --typescript --pnpm
dev react_native_cli NativeApp --bun
```

Skip dependency installation where supported:

```bash
dev next web-app --no-install
dev fastapi my-api --no-install
dev django my-app --python python3.13
```

## Project Lifecycle

Run these commands from a project root or any child directory:

```bash
dev install
dev run
dev test
dev build
dev check
dev clean
dev open
```

You can also pass a project path:

```bash
dev test ../my-api
dev build ~/Projects/my-app
dev open ~/Projects/my-app --editor cursor
```

DevCmd detects projects using files such as `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `manage.py`, `pubspec.yaml`, `gradlew`, `.xcworkspace`, and `.xcodeproj`. Node package managers are selected from lockfiles. Node lifecycle commands use the project's `package.json` scripts; Python commands prefer the project's `.venv`.

`dev inspect` reports the detected type, root, package manager, and the exact command resolved for every lifecycle action. Unsupported actions are shown with a reason instead of failing the whole inspection.

`dev check` runs the quality sequence supported by the detected project:

- Node.js: available `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, then `build` scripts
- Python: Ruff when configured, then pytest and package build
- Flutter: analyze then test
- Android: Gradle lint and test
- iOS: Xcode analyze and build

Current native defaults:

- Flutter build: `flutter build apk`
- Android run/install: `./gradlew installDebug`
- Android build: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- iOS build/test/clean: `xcodebuild` with the detected workspace or project
- iOS automatic run is intentionally not provided because it requires an explicit scheme and destination

Open platform tools:

```bash
dev open android
dev open ios
```

## Device Commands

```bash
dev devices
dev android Pixel_9_Pro_Fold
dev android Pixel_9_Pro_Fold --cold-boot
dev ios "iPhone 17 Pro"
dev ios --shutdown-all
```

`dev devices` shows device name, runtime, and `Booted`/`Shutdown` status.

The standalone `dev android` and `dev ios` commands manage devices. They do not create native source projects.

## Configuration

DevCmd stores user defaults in `~/.devcmd/config.json`:

```bash
dev config
dev config set packageManager pnpm
dev config set initializeGit false
dev config set python python3.13
dev config set editor cursor
```

Default configuration:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "npm",
  "initializeGit": true,
  "python": "python3",
  "editor": "code"
}
```

## Recent Projects

Successful scaffold and lifecycle commands register projects in `~/.devcmd/projects.json`:

```bash
dev projects
dev open recent
```

## Shell Completion

Generate completion for the current shell:

```bash
dev completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_dev
dev completion bash > ~/.devcmd-completion.bash
```

For Zsh, ensure `~/.zfunc` is included in `fpath`. For Bash, source the generated file from `.bashrc`. Completion generation itself prints a pure shell script, so it can also be evaluated or managed by a dotfiles tool.

The generated completion registers both executable names: `dev` and `devcmd`.

## History

```bash
dev history
dev again
dev again --dry-run
```

The latest 50 successful commands are stored in `~/.devcmd/history.json`.

History entries store executables and argument arrays instead of shell command strings. Compatible older entries are rebuilt from their saved metadata before `dev again` runs them.

## Options

```text
--dry-run
--typescript, --ts
--javascript, --js
--package-manager <npm|pnpm|yarn|bun>, --pm <npm|pnpm|yarn|bun>
--npm, --pnpm, --yarn, --bun
--git, --no-git
--eslint, --no-eslint
--install, --no-install
--python <executable>
--editor <executable>
--set <name=value>
--cold-boot
--shutdown-all
```

## Development

DevCmd does not execute generated commands through a shell. Every executable and argument is passed separately to Node.js `spawn`, and multi-step operations such as scaffolding followed by `git init` run as separate processes.

```text
dev                 CLI entry point
src/cli.js          Prompt and command orchestration
src/commands/       Framework, device, and history commands
src/config/         Branding, version, user paths, and defaults
src/devices/        Android and iOS discovery
src/handlers/       CLI command handlers
src/projects/       Detection, lifecycle adapters, and recent-project registry
src/recipes/        Built-in and custom framework recipe engine
src/runtime/        Shared command execution flow
src/runner/         Command formatting and process execution
src/utils/          Argument parsing and validation
test/               Node.js unit tests
```

Run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

### Release

Create a release interactively and choose `patch`, `minor`, `major`, the current version, or a custom semantic version:

```bash
npm run release
```

On macOS, double-click `release.command` in Finder to open Terminal and choose either a real release or a dry-run preview. The launcher runs the release through a Zsh login shell so Node.js, NVM, and GitHub CLI remain available without loading Zsh configuration inside Bash. It keeps the window open after an error so the message can be reviewed.

The release script validates Git and GitHub CLI state, checks that local `main` is not behind `origin/main`, runs tests and package validation, updates `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and the tagged-install version in this README, commits all current changes, creates an annotated tag, pushes the branch and tag, and creates a GitHub Release with generated notes.

Use a specific increment or version for automation:

```bash
npm run release -- patch
npm run release -- minor
npm run release -- 3.0.0
```

Preview all checks and the release plan without changing the repository or publishing anything:

```bash
npm run release -- patch --dry-run
```

Pass `--yes` for a non-interactive release or `--draft` to create a draft GitHub Release. The `gh` CLI must be installed and authenticated with `gh auth login`.

`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` are forwarded to the active child process. DevCmd preserves child exit codes, uses `127` for missing executables, and uses conventional signal exit codes such as `130` for `SIGINT`.

Lifecycle behavior is implemented through project adapters under `src/projects/adapters/`. Detection, inspection, and execution all use the same adapters, preventing displayed commands from drifting away from commands that actually run.

## Custom Framework Recipes

All default framework commands are built-in recipes stored in `src/recipes/built-ins.json`. User recipes use the same validation, placeholder resolver, structured process execution, detection, and lifecycle pipeline. DevCmd does not load project-local recipes automatically; only recipes placed in the trusted user directory are discovered:

```text
~/.devcmd/recipes/*.json
```

List active recipes and their source:

```bash
dev recipes
```

Validate a recipe before installing it:

```bash
dev recipes validate ./my-backend.json
mkdir -p ~/.devcmd/recipes
cp ./my-backend.json ~/.devcmd/recipes/
```

A minimal multi-step recipe can define inputs, safe file actions, executable requirements, detection rules, and lifecycle commands:

```json
{
  "name": "my_backend",
  "description": "Example custom backend",
  "capabilities": { "git": true },
  "inputs": {
    "module": {
      "description": "Module identifier",
      "required": true
    }
  },
  "requirements": [
    "node",
    "tool-cli",
    { "value": "git", "when": { "option": "git", "equals": true } }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "type": "mkdir", "path": "." },
    { "type": "write", "path": ".devcmd-recipe", "content": "my_backend\n" },
    {
      "type": "run",
      "executable": "tool-cli",
      "args": ["init", "--module", "{module}"],
      "cwd": "{target}"
    }
  ],
  "detect": {
    "priority": 10,
    "rules": [{ "files": [".devcmd-recipe"] }]
  },
  "lifecycle": {
    "run": [{ "type": "run", "executable": "tool-cli", "args": ["run"], "cwd": "{root}" }],
    "test": [{ "type": "run", "executable": "tool-cli", "args": ["test"], "cwd": "{root}" }],
    "build": [{ "type": "run", "executable": "tool-cli", "args": ["build"], "cwd": "{root}" }]
  }
}
```

Run it like a built-in framework:

```bash
dev my_backend my-api --set module=example.com/my-api --dry-run
dev my_backend my-api --set module=example.com/my-api
```

Supported scaffold and lifecycle action types are `run`, `mkdir`, `write`, and `copy`. File destinations are restricted to the target project, `copy` sources must remain inside the recipe directory, and existing files are not overwritten. Recipe commands never use `shell: true` or shell command strings. A user recipe with the same name overrides its built-in recipe.

## AI Agent Skills

DevCmd keeps reusable AI instructions in a vendor-neutral directory:

```text
.ai/skills/                 Canonical skill source
.claude/skills              Claude Code discovery link
.agents/skills              Codex discovery link
AGENTS.md                   Independent Codex instructions
CLAUDE.md                   Independent Claude Code instructions
```

`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` do not import or reference each other. Each agent has independent project instructions, while both discovery directories point to `.ai/skills` so Claude Code and Codex use the same canonical skill content.

Each skill uses a portable `SKILL.md` as its required entrypoint. Vendor-specific UI metadata is intentionally omitted so the same skill directories remain neutral between Claude Code and Codex.

These AI instruction files are contributor tooling stored in the GitHub repository. They are not included in the globally installed CLI package produced by `npm pack`.

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `devcmd-add-framework` | Add framework scaffolding end to end using current official practices. |
| `devcmd-add-lifecycle-adapter` | Add project detection and lifecycle command resolution. |
| `devcmd-review-command-safety` | Audit input validation, child processes, history, and cleanup safety. |
| `devcmd-add-device-provider` | Extend device discovery and control without requiring real devices in tests. |
| `devcmd-debug-cli` | Reproduce, classify, fix, and regression-test CLI failures. |
| `devcmd-release-check` | Validate versioning, packaging, tags, installation, and GitHub releases. |
| `devcmd-update-docs` | Keep README, help, completion, examples, and installation guidance aligned. |
